                <h1>History of SAMA-CARE</h1>
                <p className="details">This great organization was brought about by mister Sama. It all happened when his father<br/>
                was sick with the deadly cancer disease and after returning with his father from abroad decided<br/>
                to start-up an organization where people could easily get to when they are in need of someone to<br/>
                for their love ones while they follow their busy schedules. He had always had the dream to carter<br/>
                for people and this was his big opportunity to bring hope not just to dying people but to those who<br/>
                thought all hope is gone. He later brought in a manager Mr Bless who networked with the CEO of the<br/>
                TIC(Tech Innovative Company) to start-up the TIC summer training in Bamenda and later start the S7<br/>
                SUMMER INTERNSHIP program for university students. SAMA-CARE is in the process of starting a practical<br/>
                Nursery and Primary school. This place is located in Bamenda at Hospital-Roundabout behind CAMCCUL.</p>
